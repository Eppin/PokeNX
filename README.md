Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl RNG tool with SysBot support for reading RAM data.

- Global seed
- Egg seed
- Wild encounter

This tool is a combination of multiple tools (see [credits](#credits)) and using [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net) as a GUI framework to make it cross compile for Windows, macOS and Linux.

## Usage
